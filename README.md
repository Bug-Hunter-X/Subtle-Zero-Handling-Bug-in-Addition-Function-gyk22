# Subtle Zero-Handling Bug in JavaScript Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to handling zero values in a simple addition function.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, which incorrectly returns 0 if either input is 0, regardless of the other input's value. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering edge cases and potential pitfalls when working with numerical data in JavaScript.
